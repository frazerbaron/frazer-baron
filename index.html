            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
                            If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) are systems, such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce; have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.
                            This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.
                            In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs,show that clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository. Thus if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.</p>

                            On branch master<br>

                             You can tell that it’s staged because it’s under the “Changes to be committed” heading</p>
